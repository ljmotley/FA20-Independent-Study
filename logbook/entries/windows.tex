If scientific computing lives at the Linux command line,
then being a Windows users can be tricky.
The two parts of our workflow that are most difficult to implement on Windows
are executing Makefiles and creating symbolic links.

There are a variety of ways to run Make.

using

This entry describes how to use GitBash to run Make.

We are only aware of one way to get Windows
to create symbolic links using \texttt{ln -s}.
(Windows typically uses a distinct \texttt{mklink} syntax).
It employs GitBash and is described below.

\subsection{Install GitBash}
Download and install GitBash here from
\url{https://git-scm.com/downloads}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Please make sure to pick ``commit Unix-style line endings''

    \end{figure}
    \item Please also check enable symbolic links (should be checked by default)

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Install \texttt{make}}
Source: \url{https://gist.github.com/evanwill/0207876c3243bbb6863e65ec5dc3f058#make}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Go to ezwinports (\url{https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/}).
    \item Download \texttt{make-4.1-2-without-guile-w32-bin.zip} (get the version without guile).
    \item Extract zip.
    \item Copy the contents to your \texttt{Git{\textbackslash}mingw64{\textbackslash}} merging the folders,
        but do NOT overwrite/replace any existing files.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Install \texttt{wget}}
Source: \url{https://gist.github.com/evanwill/0207876c3243bbb6863e65ec5dc3f058#wget}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Download the lastest wget binary for windows from eternallybored
        (\url{https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/});
        they are available as a zip with documentation, or just an exe.
    \item If you downloaded the zip, extract all (if windows built in zip utility gives an error, use 7-zip).
    \item Rename the file \texttt{wget64.exe} to \texttt{wget.exe} if necessary.
    \item Move wget.exe to your \texttt{Git{\textbackslash}mingw64{\textbackslash}bin{\textbackslash}}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Create symbolic links on Windows using \texttt{ln -s}}
To do so, you need to run GitBash as Administrator
    (instructions to \textit{always} run GitBash as Administrator are the end).

\noindent \textit{NOTE}: 
Executing the steps below will overwrite
the default behavior of \texttt{ln} on GitBash.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open GitBash
\item
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
cd ~
echo 'export MSYS=winsymlinks:nativestrict' >> .bash_profile
echo 'export MSYS=winsymlinks:nativestrict' >> .bashrc
\end{lstlisting}
\item Close all GitBash windows.
\end{enumerate}
Technically, you should only have to edit either
\texttt{.bash\_profile} or \texttt{.bashrc},
but sources differ and experiences differ.
Anyway, it won't hurt to do both.

\subsubsection{Optional: Always run GitBash as Administrator}

\noindent \textit{NOTE}: Only the part mentioned below is needed.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Click the Windows Start button and type Git Bash
    \item Right-click the found link and select ``Open file location''
    \item Right-click the menu shortcut and select ``Properties''
    \item On the ``Compatibility'' tab, check the box ``Run this program as an administrator''.
    \item Click ``OK'' at the bottom
\end{enumerate}
